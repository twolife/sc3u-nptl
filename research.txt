pthread_kill() is used by the game as a mean to know if a thread exist or not.
It was working with LinuxThreads, but a call to that function crash with NPTL if the pthread_t isn't valid.

Maybe change the binary to never make those call to pthread_kill(thread_id, 0) ?

push    0			; 6A00
mov     eax, [eax+10h]		; 8B40 10
push    eax			; 50
call    _pthread_kill		; E8C1 8AD3 FF		basically return 0 if arg1/eax != 0
test    eax, eax		; 85C0
setz    al			; OF94 C0
movzx   eax, al			; 0FB6 C0
[...]

Could be patched to:

mov     eax, [eax+10h]		; 8B40 10
test    eax, eax		; 85C0
setz    al			; OF94 C0
xor     al,1			; 3401
NOP     			; 9090 9090 9090
movzx   eax, al			; 0FB6 C0
[...]


They use SIGSTOP/SIGCONT as a way of doing synchronisation between threads.

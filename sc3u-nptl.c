/**
 * SimCityâ„¢ 3000 Unlimited for modern Linux
 *
 * In July 2000, [Loki Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_Entertainment)
 * released a Linux native version of this game.
 * If you try to run the game now, all you will get is `Segmentation fault`
 *
 * But why? The story is interesting :-)
 *
 * Back in 2000 the Linux kernel did not have real support for threading,
 * but it did support processes as schedulable entities through the clone()
 * system call. This call created a copy of the calling process, with
 * the copy sharing the address space of the caller.
 * The LinuxThreads project used this system call to simulate thread support
 * entirely in user space. This approach had numerous disadvantages
 * and that threading model did not conform to POSIX requirements.
 *
 * LinuxThreads was gradualy replaced by NPTL (Native POSIX Thread Library).
 * NPTL requires facilities which were specifically added into the v2.6
 * of the Linux kernel (that version was released in December 2003).
 * LinuxThreads has been removed from glibc since v2.4 (2006).
 *
 * SC3U was, of course, developped and tested only with LinuxThreads in mind.
 * The game relies on 2 "non POSIX compliant" behaviors from LinuxThreads and
 * it segfault if you try to run it with a modern NPTL based glibc.
 *  1. It tries to use pthread_kill() on an invalid thread ID
 *     https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=169995
 *  2. POSIX dictate that delivering pthread_kill() with SIGSTOP to a thread
 *     will actually stop _all_ threads in that process.
 *     But with LinuxThreads you could stop/resume a particular thread with
 *     SIGCSTOP/SIGCONT. The game use this as a way of doing synchronisation
 *     between threads.
 *
 * The following code is an attempt at fixing those 2 issues and allows you
 * to run this old game on modern systems.
